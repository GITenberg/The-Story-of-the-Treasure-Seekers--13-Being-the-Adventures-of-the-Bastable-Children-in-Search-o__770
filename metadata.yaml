description: "The Story of the Treasure Seekers is a novel by E. Nesbit. First published\
  \ in 1899, it tells the story of Dora, Oswald, Dicky, Alice, Noel, and Horace Octavius\
  \ (H. O.) Bastable, and their attempts to assist their widowed father and recover\
  \ the fortunes of their family; its sequels are The Wouldbegoods (1899) and The\
  \ New Treasure Seekers (1904). The novel's complete name is The Story of the Treasure\
  \ Seekers: Being the Adventures of the Bastable Children in Search of a Fortune.\
  \ The original edition included illustrations by H. R. Millar. The Puffin edition\
  \ (1958) was illustrated by Cecil Leslie.\nThe story is told from a child's point\
  \ of view. The narrator is Oswald, but on the first page he announces:\n\"It is\
  \ one of us that tells this story â€“ but I shall not tell you which: only at the\
  \ very end perhaps I will. While the story is going on you may be trying to guess,\
  \ only I bet you don't.\"\nHowever, his occasional lapse into first person, and\
  \ the undue praise he likes to heap on himself, makes his identity obvious to the\
  \ attentive reader long before he reveals it himself.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
